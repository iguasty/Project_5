# Project_5
 Searching


**Design:**

Here is my project utilizing the grid function in tkinter to make an array of 100 boxes that are populated with random numbers. The user inputs a number to search for in the entry box and hits enter to start the search function. The program then goes through each box and highlights it yellow as it checks to see if it is the same value as the number being searched for. It continues to search through all the boxes until it encounters the box that has the correct number in it and highlights it green. If the search does not find the number in the array, then it outputs to the terminal saying the number was not found.


**Testing**
